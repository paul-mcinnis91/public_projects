# Introduction

## Background
This program was designed with the goal of creating a data visualization of where words in the english language originate from. The first half of this project is to pull from dictionary.com via API using python and to draw the data and a JSON file to store the data. Once all the data is gathered locally and all words that are in the words_alpha.txt have been queried, the dataset will be complete (for now). As we wait for the data to arrive in full we will create a visualization of this data that can be viewed by end users.

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to explain the architecture of the program and how it each aspect of the program interacts with each other. 

## Scope
